## A bit of background

From its inception in 2002 the site was PHP driven and hosted on two or three different servers.

In 2020 costs were increasing and the decision was taken to close the site, transferring the content to GitHub Pages. Just in time the site was rescued by the generous offer of free web space. By then the site had been completely rewritten as a static website built using Jekyll and uploaded to this repository.

For just over a year the Jekyll site was maintained here but builds were uploaded to the new host's server. Unfortunately in late 2021 the new provider seemed to be experiencing problems. So, in mid December 2021, the GitHub pages site became the main host and the delphidabbler.com domain was "pointed" at the GitHub Pages servers.

And so here we are!
