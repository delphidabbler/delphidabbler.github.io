## A bit of background

When this project was first launched it was thought that delphidabbler.com was due to close.

The idea was that much of the content from the old website would be moved to a new GitHub Pages site.

However, almost at the last minute, a generous offer from [Creo Hosting](https://www.creohosting.com/) to host the site saved the day and delphidabbler.com could continue.

Although Creo had facilities to run the old PHP driven site with only some minor tweaks, that wasn't done for two reasons:

1. The old site really needed a major modernisation to give it a fresher look and to make it mobile friendly.
2. A lot of work had been put into porting the site to a Jekyll driven site on GitHub Pages.

So, this repo was repurposed to maintain the code for the main site. The GitHub Pages site is used to test changes before publishing the generated content to the main site.
