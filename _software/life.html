			Development of <em>{{ page.title }}</em> is frozen.

		<p>
			This program has roots going back to a Turbo Pascal DOS program from 1992. It's Windows incarnation goes back to 1997 and my first attempts at OOP using Delphi 1. And it shows in the coding!
		</p>
		<p>
			Because this is possibly my oldest surving program I can't bear to dump it, so I gave it a minimal makeover in 2015 and then decided to mothball it, which means I'm not developing it further. In the unlikely event anyone wants to take it over, the source code is available below.

			There is no support available for this program. Please do not report any bugs or contact me about it.
