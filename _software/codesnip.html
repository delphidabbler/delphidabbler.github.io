      Overview
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> is an open source code bank for storing and viewing code snippets. It not only manages, displays and manipulates your own code snippets but it can also incorporate snippets downloaded from the <em>DelphiDabbler Code Snippets Database</em>.
    </p>

		</p>
    <p>
      Snippets can be displayed by category, alphabetically or by type. Full details of a selected snippet are displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designed with Pascal in mind, <em>CodeSnip</em> enables Delphi or Free Pascal code snippets to be test-compiled with any installed version of those compilers. Use this feature to validate the syntax of code without having to start your compiler's IDE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Code in other languages can be stored in <em>CodeSnip</em> although syntax highlighting, source file generation and compiler checking will not be available.
    </p>
    <p>
      The database can be searched for snippets that contain specified text or for cross referenced snippets. The snippets to be displayed can also be selected manually. In addition you can search for Pascal snippets that compile under given versions of Delphi or Free Pascal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequently used snippets can be marked as &quot;favourites&quot; for quick  access.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> can generate and export Pascal source code in various ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Compilable Object Pascal units containing selected snippets from the database can be generated and written to file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Individual snippets or whole categories can be written to Object Pascal include files or copied to the clipboard for including in Delphi and FreePascal projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Information about snippets can copied or printed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Selected snippets can be exported to files that can be shared with other <em>CodeSnip</em> users.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Units and Pascal include files can also be exported as syntax highlighted XHTML or rich text files. The syntax highlighter can be customized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, <em>CodeSnip</em> comes in two editions: standard and portable.
