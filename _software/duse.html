      Overview
    </h2>
  </div>

    <p>
      <em>DUSE</em> is a little Windows GUI tool for Delphi programmers to find the <a href="https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Alexandria/en/Unit_Scope_Names">unit scope(s)</a> that a unit belongs to and copies the fully qualified unit name to the clipboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the introduction of unit scopes to Delphi I've been struggling to remember which scopes some units belong to. OK, sometimes the code editor pops up a list of unit names in a scope, but what I wanted was to type in a unit name and be told what unit scopes(s) the unit may belong to.
    </p>
    <p>
      This program does that. When you have found the required unit scope name you can copy the fully qualified unit name to the clipboard ready for pasting into your code editor. It will also let you examine a unit scope to see what units it contains.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have to teach <em>DUSE</em> about what units exist and the unit scopes they belong to. The program makes this easy to do. It finds installed versions of Delphi and can automatically read the units in an installation's source code directory. Alternatively it can scan directory trees and extract the unit names from any <code>.pas</code> or <code>.dcu</code> files that it finds. <em>DUSE</em> can remember more than one set of unit-scope name &quot;mappings&quot;, which makes it useful for using with different versions of Delphi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program is available in either 64 bit 32 bit Windows versions. You should always use the 64 bit version if you are running 64 bit Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      No non-Windows version is (or will be) available, simply because the program is designed for use alongside the Windows-only Delphi IDE.

        Before release v0.3.0 <em>DUSE</em> was named <em>Unit2NS</em>, which stood for <em>Unit to namespace</em>. But someone pointed out that the program wasn't dealing with namespaces, but with unit scope names. Which buggered up using "NS" to stand for "namespace". Cue the rewriting of the UI and docs and, eventually, a new name!
