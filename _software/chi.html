      Overview
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
		<p>
			<em>Component Help Installer (CHI)</em> installs Delphi-compatible help files into Delphi's OpenHelp system in such a way that the help files are integrated with Delphi. Context sensitive help for components, classes and routines installed by <em>CHI</em> is accessible from the Delphi code editor, form editor and property inspector. <em>CHI</em> works with Delphi versions 3 to 7 only.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>CHI</em> comes in two flavours:
		</p>

		<ol class="wide">
			<li>
				A stand-alone Windows application (<code>CHI.exe</code>). This detects which versions of Delphi are installed on the system and allows any available version to be chosen from the main interface.
			</li>
			<li>
				A command line application (<code>CHInst.exe</code>) is provided mainly to enable installation of help files from batch files. The program can also be called from install programs. It provides all the functionality of the GUI based application through a command line interface. The <em>CHI</em> help file provides an example of using the command line application.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			When used with Delphi 6 and 7 <em>CHI</em> will merge any <code>.als</code> a-keyword files found in the same directory as the help file into Delphi's master <code>.als</code> file. This feature works only with Delphi 6 and 7, since <code>.als</code> files are not supported in earlier versions of Delphi.
		</p>

			<h3>
				Using WinHelp with Windows Vista through to Windows 8.1
			</h3>
			<p>
				Starting with Windows Vista, WinHelp is not installed by default. It must be downloaded and installed separately. See Microsoft Knowledge Base article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/917607">KB917607</a> for details.
			</p>
			<p class="alert alert-danger glyph">
				As noted above, Windows 10 and later do not support WinHelp at all.
