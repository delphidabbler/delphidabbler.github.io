      Overview
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
		<p>
			<em>Component Help Installer (CHI)</em> installs Delphi-compatible help files into Delphi's OpenHelp system in such a way that the help files are integrated with Delphi. Context sensitive help for components, classes and routines installed by <em>CHI</em> is accessible from the Delphi code editor, form editor and property inspector. <em>CHI</em> works with Delphi versions 3 to 7.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>CHI</em> comes in two flavours:
		</p>

		<ol class="wide">
			<li>
				A stand-alone Windows application (<code>CHI.exe</code>). This detects which versions of Delphi are installed on the system and allows any available version to be chosen from the main interface.
			</li>
			<li>
				A command line application (<code>CHInst.exe</code>) is provided mainly to enable installation of help files from batch files. The program can also be called from install programs. It provides all the functionality of the GUI based application through a command line interface. The <em>CHI</em> help file provides an example of using the command line application.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			When used with Delphi 6 and 7 <em>CHI</em> will merge any <code>.als</code> a-keyword files found in the same directory as the help file into Delphi's master <code>.als</code> file. This feature works only with Delphi 6 and 7, since <code>.als</code> files are not supported in earlier versions of Delphi.

				Using WinHelp with Windows Vista through to Windows 8.1
			</h3>
			<p>
				Starting with Windows Vista, WinHelp is not installed by default. It must be downloaded and installed separately. See Microsoft Knowledge Base article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917607">KB917607</a> for details.
			</p>
			<p class="alert alert-danger glyph">
				As noted above, Windows 10 does not support WinHelp at all.

			The following downloads for <em>CHI</em> are hosted on GoogleDrive:
		</p>
		<ul class="wide">
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>The executable program: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8qEVqTUMgmJRU1KNW9rRHUzTjA/view?usp=sharing">chi-exe.zip</a>.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					This zip file includes a standard Windows installer which should be extracted from the zip file and run. The installer needs administrator privileges to run and will ask permission on Windows Vista and later.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>The source code: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8qEVqTUMgmJN2dYMjFWMUF4Mms/view?usp=sharing">chi-src.zip</a>.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					This download includes the source code of the final version of <em>CHI</em>. Create a new folder to hold the source code and then unzip the file into it, preserving the directory structure.
				</p>

					<strong>Subversion repository dump: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8qEVqTUMgmJSDV1RjdDOS1BR1U/view?usp=sharing">chi-svndump.zip</a>.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					This is aimed at anyone wanting to take over development of the program. The repo stores all changes to the source code from <em>CHI</em> v2.2.1 to v3.0.0.
				</p>
				<p>
					To use the repository first extract <code>chi-svndump</code> from the zip file, then import it into a clean Subversion repository. See the Subversion documentation for details of how to do this.
				</p>
				<p>
					The repository contains branches off the <code>tags</code> branch that contain the source code of releases 2.2.1 and 3.0.0. The <code>trunk</code> branch contains the current development tree which, as supplied, is the same as the v3.0.0 <code>tags</code> branch. You should use <code>trunk</code> to make any changes. The <code>tags</code> branches should be left unchanged. Snapshots of any new releases should be added there.
