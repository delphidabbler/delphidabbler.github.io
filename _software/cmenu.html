			Development of <em>{{ page.title }}</em> is frozen.
		</p>
		<p>
			This component was originally written back in 2001 when I needed a simple colour menu component for an app I was writing. That was in the pre-XP, pre-themes days. The component has never been updated to adopt the &quot;modern&quot; (XP &amp; later) look and feel, so now it looks rather dated.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have no further need for the component and it would be quite a lot of work to make it themes-aware. Given that there are much better colour menu components out there, it just doesn't seem worth the effort. So I've decided to abandon the project.

      Overview
    </h2>

  <div class="panel-body">
		<p>
			The colour menu component, <em>TPJColourPopupMenu</em>, is an open source non-visual component that descends from <em>TPopupMenu</em>. It implements a pop-up menu that gives access to the 16 basic Windows colours. The menu can be displayed over one, two, four or eight columns. It can also be displayed in one of the four following styles:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>Text only</em> &ndash; the menu displays just the name of each colour.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Text and colour</em> &ndash; the menu displays the colour name along with a small bitmap illustrating the colour.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Colour only</em> &ndash; colour swatches are displayed without any text (like a palette).
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Owner draw</em> &ndash; the user provides code that draws the menu items.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The colour names are in English. However, it is easy to provide names in other languages or use Delphi colour identifiers etc. This is done by handling one of the component's events. The accompanying demo program shows how to do this.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are three examples of how the menu can appear:

					A component editor (accessed from a mouse menu when the component is selected) that gives easy access to all the component's main properties. Here is a screenshot of the component editor:
