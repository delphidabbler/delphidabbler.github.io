			Development of <em>{{ page.title }}</em> is frozen.

		<p>
			This program was written as a programming exercise back in 1999 and it shows in the source code â€“ I wouldn't write that code now! <em>BoobyTrap!</em> received only one main update in 2008 when the help system was changed. Other than that there have only been a few bug fix releases.	
		</p>
		<p>
			In October 2013 the program received its final update to make it compile with Delphi XE and support the Unicode Windows API.

		<p>
			If you want to take over development, please do so. The source code is available below.
