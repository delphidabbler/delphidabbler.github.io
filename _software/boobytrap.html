			Development of <em>{{ page.title }}</em> is frozen.

		<p>
			This program was written as a programming exercise back in 1999 and it shows in the source code â€“ I wouldn't write that code now! <em>BoobyTrap!</em> received only one main update in 2008 when the help system was changed. Other than that there have only been a few bug fix releases.
		</p>
		<p>
			In October 2013 the program received its final update to make it compile with Delphi XE and support the Unicode Windows API.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to take over development, please do so. The source code of v1.1.2, along with a dump of a Subversion repository containing the code, is available below.

				</p>
				<p>
					This zip file includes a standard Windows installer which should be extracted from the zip file and run. The installer needs administrator privileges to run and will ask permission on Windows Vista and later. For more information see the read-me file included in the zip file.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>The source code: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8qEVqTUMgmJbW1QTTlXMHVRYVU/view?usp=sharing">boobytrap-src.zip</a>.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					This download includes the source code of the final version of the program. Create a new folder to hold the source code and then unzip the file into it, preserving the directory structure. Then follow the instructions in the included <code>Compiling.txt</code> file.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Subversion repository dump: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8qEVqTUMgmJa0dHTHhEMnozOFU/view?usp=sharing">boobytrap-svndump.zip</a>.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					This is aimed at anyone wanting to take over development of the program.
				</p>
				<p>
					To use the repository first extract <code>boobytrap-svndump</code> from the zip file, then import it into a clean Subversion repository. See the Subversion documentation for details of how to do this.
				</p>
				<p>
					The repository contains branches off the <code>tags</code> branch that contain the source code of releases 1.0.0 to 1.1.2. The <code>trunk</code> branch contains the current development tree which, as supplied, is the same as the v1.1.2 <code>tags</code> branch. You should use <code>trunk</code> to make any changes. The <code>tags</code> branches should be left unchanged. Create a new tag branch for each release.
				</p>
