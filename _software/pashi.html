    <h3>
      PasHi command line program
    </h3>
    <p>
      <em>PasHi</em> PasHi is a fully featured command line program that highlights Pascal source code. It reads the original source code from standard input, files or the clipboard and writes the highlighted code as HTML to standard output, a file, or the clipboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML 4, XHTML and HTML 5 are all supported. CSS is used for styling. Style sheets may be external or can be embedded in the HTML document. Several predefined style sheets may be installed with the program. You can also create your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>PasHi</em> can either generate complete HTML documents or just fragments of HTML code. Output files can be in UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO-8859-1 or Windows-1252 format.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML fragments make it easy to embed highlighted code in existing web pages. Web page authors simply need to ensure that the necessary CSS classes are available. The easiest way to do this is to use an external style sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ability to highlight code via the clipboard is the program's most unique feature and it makes <em>PasHi</em> very easy to use. You simply copy the required source code to the clipboard and run <em>PasHi</em> with the necessary parameters. The highlighted code will replace the original source on the clipboard ready for pasting into a document. This is particularly useful when combined with the option that creates HTML fragments because it simplifies writing documents that contain several Pascal source examples.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Optional GUI
    </h3>
    <p>
      <em>PasHiGUI</em>, an optional GUI front end for <em>PasHi</em>, is included in the release. This provides a point and click interface to <em>PasHi</em>. Most, but not all, of <em>PasHi</em>'s command line options are supported. Files and text can be dragged and dropped onto the GUI to highlight them.
    </p>
    <h3>
      User guide
    </h3>
    <p>
      A user guide is installed with the program that explains the usage of the program and all its parameters. The user guide also has an explanation of the CSS classes required by <em>PasHi</em>-generated HTML. If <em>PasHiGUI</em> is installed the user guide can be displayed from <em>PasHiGUI</em>'s help menu.
