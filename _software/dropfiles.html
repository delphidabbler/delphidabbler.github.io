      Overview
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
      The <em>Drop Files Components</em> pack includes three components that support drag and drop from Windows Explorer along with subsidiary components that can filter dropped files.
    </p>
    <p>
      The components are:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        TPJDropFiles
      </dt>
      <dd>
         A container control that catches files dragged and dropped onto its client area or the client area of child controls.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        TPFormDropFiles
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A non-visual component that catches files dragged and dropped from Explorer onto the form that contains the component.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        TPJCtrlDropFiles
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A non-visual component that catches files dragged and dropped from Explorer onto an associated control.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        TPJExtFileFilter
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A file filter component that filters files according to their extension.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        TPJWildCardFileFilter
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A file filter component that filters files according to a DOS-style wild card.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        TPJFileFilter
      </dt>
      <dd>
        An abstract base class for file filter components. Developers should derive any new filter components from this class.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      Some design time assistance is provided by component and property editors.
    </p>
    <p class="alert alert-warning glyph">
      For security reasons in Windows Vista and later, drag/drop is disallowed between windows with different security permissions. This means that applications that processes drag and drop may not be able to receive files dragged and droppped from another window if the security permissions are not compatible.<br><strong><span class="fa fa-times-circle fa-x-pad-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>Please do not report this behaviour as a bug<span class="fa fa-times-circle fa-x-pad-left" aria-hidden="true"></span></strong>

      Features
    </h3>
    <div id="features" class="collapse"> <!-- begin collapsible #features section -->
      <p>
        Key features of <var>TPJDropFiles</var>, <var>TPJCtrlDropFiles</var> and <var>TPJFormDropFiles</var> are:
      </p>
      <ul class="wide">
        <li>
          An <var>OnDropFiles</var> event is triggered when files are dropped.
        </li>
        <li>
          The names of dropped files are made available through the <var>Files</var> array property. For convenience, the name of the first such file is also stored in the <var>FileName</var> property.
        </li>
        <li>
          The list of dropped files can be configured to include only files, only folders or all files and folders.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dropped folders can be recursed so that all the files and sub-folders in each of the dropped folders are listed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Filters can be applied to the dropped files and folders. This is done either by linking to a filter component (see above) or by handling the <var>OnFileFilter</var> event and deciding which files and folders to pass through the filter in the event handler.
        </li>
        <li>
          The mouse co-ordinates where the files were dropped can be retrieved, as can a reference to any control under the mouse cursor at the time.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <var>OnBeforeDrop</var> event can be used to perform pre-processing before the files are actually dropped.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <var>IsFolder</var> array property tells if the equivalent item from <var>Files</var> array is a file or a folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          The owning window can be brought to the front when files are dropped.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some design time assistance is provided by component and property editors.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Demo code
    </h3>
    <div id="demo" class="collapse"> <!-- begin collapsible #demo section -->
      <p>
        The source code for two demo programs is included:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The main demo program exercises all three drop files components and the filter components.
        </li>
        <li>
          A program that demonstrates how to use <var>TPJCtrlDropFiles</var> with frames.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div> <!-- /#demo -->

      How the components work
    </h3>
    <div id="how-it-works" class="collapse"> <!-- begin collapsible #how-it-works section -->
      <p>
        <var>TPJDropFiles</var> notifies Windows that it accepts file drop operations by using the <var>DragAcceptFiles</var> API call. It then responds to <var>WM_DROPFILES</var> messages sent by Windows whenever files are dropped on its window.
      </p>
      <p>
        <var>TPJFormDropFiles</var> and <var>TPJCtrlDropFiles</var> act in a similar way to <var>TPJDropFiles</var> except that they subclass an associated window and respond to <var>WM_DROPFILES</var> messages on the window's behalf. <var>TPJFormDropFiles</var> subclasses its owner form while <var>TPJCtrlDropFiles</var> subclasses the window of an associated <var>TWinControl</var>. The last two components derive from a common abstract base class.
      </p>
      <p>

      Installation
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
      The <em>Drop Files Components</em> are supplied in a zip file. Before installing you need to extract all the files from the zip file, preserving the directory structure. The following files will be extracted:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong><code>PJDropFiles.pas</code></strong> &ndash; component source code.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong><code>PJDropFiles.dcr</code></strong> &ndash; component palette glyphs.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong><code>PJDropFilesDsgn.pas</code></strong> &ndash; property editors and component registration source code.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong><code>PJDropFilesDsgn.dfm</code></strong> &ndash; property editor form.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <code>ReadMe.htm</code> &ndash; read-me file.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <code>ChangeLog.txt</code> &ndash; component's change log.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <code>MPL-2.txt</code> &ndash; the Mozilla Public License v2.0.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <code>Documentation.URL</code> &ndash; short-cut to the component's online documentation.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <code>PJDropFiles.hlp</code> &ndash; component help file that integrates with the Delphi 3-7 OpenHelp system. <span class="text-warning bg-warning glyph">Deprecated</span>
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <code>PJDropFiles.als</code> &ndash; a-link keyword file for integration with the Delphi 6 or 7 OpenHelp system. <span class="text-warning bg-warning glyph">Deprecated</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition to the above files you will find the source code of the two demo projects in the <code>Demo\1</code> and <code>Demo\2</code> sub-directories.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may now install the components into the Delphi IDE. To do this, the files <code>PJDropFiles.pas</code>, <code>PJDropFiles.dcr</code>, <code>PJDropFilesDsgn.pas</code> and <code>PJDropFilesDsgn.dfm</code> should be added to a design time package.
