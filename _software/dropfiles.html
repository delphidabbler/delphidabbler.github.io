      Overview
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
      The <em>{{page.title}}</em> pack includes three components that support drag and drop from Windows Explorer along with subsidiary components that can filter dropped files.
    </p>
    <p>
      The components are:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        TPJDropFiles
      </dt>
      <dd>
         A container control that catches files dragged and dropped onto its client area or the client area of child controls.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        TPFormDropFiles
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A non-visual component that catches files dragged and dropped from Explorer onto the form that contains the component.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        TPJCtrlDropFiles
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A non-visual component that catches files dragged and dropped from Explorer onto an associated control.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        TPJExtFileFilter
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A file filter component that filters files according to their extension.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        TPJWildCardFileFilter
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A file filter component that filters files according to a DOS-style wild card.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        TPJFileFilter
      </dt>
      <dd>
        An abstract base class for file filter components. Developers should derive any new filter components from this class.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      Some design time assistance is provided by component and property editors.

      Features
    </h3>
    <div id="features" class="collapse"> <!-- begin collapsible #features section -->
      <p>
        Key features of <var>TPJDropFiles</var>, <var>TPJCtrlDropFiles</var> and <var>TPJFormDropFiles</var> are:
      </p>
      <ul class="wide">
        <li>
          An <var>OnDropFiles</var> event is triggered when files are dropped.
        </li>
        <li>
          The names of dropped files are made available through the <var>Files</var> array property. For convenience, the name of the first such file is also stored in the <var>FileName</var> property.
        </li>
        <li>
          The list of dropped files can be configured to include only files, only folders or all files and folders.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dropped folders can be recursed so that all the files and sub-folders in each of the dropped folders are listed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Filters can be applied to the dropped files and folders. This is done either by linking to a filter component (see above) or by handling the <var>OnFileFilter</var> event and deciding which files and folders to pass through the filter in the event handler.
        </li>
        <li>
          The mouse co-ordinates where the files were dropped can be retrieved, as can a reference to any control under the mouse cursor at the time.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <var>OnBeforeDrop</var> event can be used to perform pre-processing before the files are actually dropped.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <var>IsFolder</var> array property tells if the equivalent item from <var>Files</var> array is a file or a folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          The owning window can be brought to the front when files are dropped.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some design time assistance is provided by component and property editors.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Demo code
    </h3>
    <div id="demo" class="collapse"> <!-- begin collapsible #demo section -->
      <p>
        The source code for two demo programs is included:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The main demo program exercises all three components and the filter components.
        </li>
        <li>
          A program that demonstrates how to use <var>TPJCtrlDropFiles</var> with frames.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div> <!-- /#demo -->

    <h3 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#how-it-works" class="collapsible collapsed">
      How the components work
    </h3>
    <div id="how-it-works" class="collapse"> <!-- begin collapsible #how-it-works section -->
      <p>
        <var>TPJDropFiles</var> notifies Windows that it accepts file drop operations by using the <var>DragAcceptFiles</var> API call. It then responds to <var>WM_DROPFILES</var> messages sent by Windows whenever files are dropped on its window.
      </p>
      <p>
        <var>TPJFormDropFiles</var> and <var>TPJCtrlDropFiles</var> act in a similar way to <var>TPJDropFiles</var> except that they subclass an associated window and respond to <var>WM_DROPFILES</var> messages on the window's behalf. <var>TPJFormDropFiles</var> subclasses its owner form while <var>TPJCtrlDropFiles</var> subclasses the window of an associated <var>TWinControl</var>. The last two components derive from a common abstract base class.
      </p>

  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
      The <em>{{page.title}}</em> are supplied in a zip file. Before installing you need to extract all the files from the zip file, preserving the directory structure. The following files will be extracted:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong><code>PJDropFiles.pas</code></strong> &ndash; component source code.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong><code>PJDropFiles.dcr</code></strong> &ndash; component palette glyphs.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong><code>PJDropFilesDsgn.pas</code></strong> &ndash; property editors and component registration source code.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong><code>PJDropFilesDsgn.dfm</code></strong> &ndash; property editor form.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <code>ReadMe.htm</code> &ndash; read-me file.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <code>ChangeLog.txt</code> &ndash; component's change log.

      <li class="list-group-item">

    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition to the above files you will find the source code of the two demo projects in the <code>Demo\1</code> and <code>Demo\2</code> sub-directories.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may now install the components into the Delphi IDE. To do this, the files <code>PJDropFiles.pas</code>, <code>PJDropFiles.dcr</code>, <code>PJDropFilesDsgn.pas</code> and <code>PJDropFilesDsgn.dfm</code> should be added to a design time package.
