    <p>
      The <em>Console Application Runner</em> classes are designed to be used to control the execution of child console application processes. There are two classes: a class named <var>TPJCustomConsoleApp</var> that is provided a base class for user-defined sub-classes, and <var>TPJConsoleApp</var> that is used to provide a general way to run and manipulate console applications. Both classes are provided in a single unit, <var>PJConsoleApp</var>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The classes enable the console application's standard input, standard output and standard error to be redirected to and from files or pipes. They can also timeslice the running of the console application to enable the calling application to continue processing and to enable redirected piped output to be processed.

      <p>
        The classes come with numerous demo programs that illustrate how to use the them. Each demo is related to an example documented in the <span aria-hidden="true"><em>Examples</em> section of the project </span><a href="http://wiki.delphidabbler.com/index.php/Docs/ConsoleAppExamples" aria-label="examples section of the project documentation">documentation</a>. There is a VCL version of each demo and a few demos also have FireMonkey 2 versions as well.

          <span class="fa fa-info-circle fa-fw fa-pull-left"></span> Please note that some of the demos use units and classes from the DelphiDabbler <a href="{{ site.base-url }}/software/ioutils.html">IO Utility Classes</a> project. Before attempting to compile the affected demos you need to download this project and copy the required units to the <code>Demos\IOUtils</code> directory.

          Users of Delphi XE5 and later must use IO Utility Classes v1.0.1 or later.

      Subversion users can check out the source code of the current release from the repository on SourceForge by doing:
    </p>
    <pre class="small pre-scrollable kbd">svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/ddablib/code/tags/projects/consoleapp/release-{{ page.version }} codedir</pre>

      Installation
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
      The <em>Console Application Runner Classes</em> are supplied in a zip file. Before installing you need to extract all the files from the zip file, preserving the directory structure. The following files will be extracted:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong><code>PJConsoleApp.pas</code></strong> &ndash; source code.
      </li>
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <code>ReadMe.htm</code> &ndash; read-me file.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <code>ChangeLog.txt</code> &ndash; project change log.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <code>MPL-2.txt</code> &ndash; the Mozilla Public License v2.0.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <code>Documentation.URL</code> &ndash; short-cut to the component's online documentation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition to the above files you will find numerous demo projects in the <code>Demos</code> sub-directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three possible ways to use the units.
    </p>
    <ol class="wide">
      <li>
        The simplest way is to add <code>PJConsoleApp.pas</code> to your projects as and when you need it.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the unit easier to re-use you can either copy it to a folder on your Delphi search path, or add the folder where you extracted the units to the search path. You then simply use the units as required without needing to add them to your project.
      </li>
      <li>
        For maximum portability you can add the unit to a Delphi design time package.
