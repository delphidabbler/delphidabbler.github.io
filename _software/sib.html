			Development of <em>{{ page.title }}</em> is frozen.

		<p>
			I developed this program to create simple, command line based installers for my programs, but my needs have changed and the program hasn't kept up. To update it would be (a) a <em>lot</em> of work and (b) pointless because the superb <a href="https://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a> does it all so well.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong class="text-danger"><span class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-x-pad-right"></span>I strongly discourage anyone from continuing to develop this program</strong> &ndash; it's had its day. I don't even know if it runs on modern versions of Windows. Having said that if you want to look at the code you can download a copy of the final version below.
