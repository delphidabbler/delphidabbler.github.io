			Development of <em>{{ page.title }}</em> is frozen.

			This wizard works only with Delphi 7, which is now quite old. Furthermore there have never had to be any updates to the wizard since the first and only release &ndash; it is quite simple and seems to just work.
		</p>
		<p>
			Therefore I'm freezing development of this code. If you want to make changes, there is enough code in the download to do that.

      Overview

		<p>
			Delphi 7 introduced a macro recording toolbar that can be used to record and play back macros. The toolbar was to be displayed in the bottom left of the editor's status bar. However, the toolbar was hidden in the release version, leaving an empty space in the first panel of the status bar as the following image shows.

			<img class="scale center-block" src="{{ site.base-url }}{{ site.data.core.software-images-base-url}}/mtdwiz-1.png" alt="Delphi Editor without macro toolbar" title="Delphi Editor without macro toolbar" />
		</p>
		<p>
			This wizard causes the hidden toolbar to be displayed in each open edit window:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img class="scale center-block" src="{{ site.base-url }}{{ site.data.core.software-images-base-url}}/mtdwiz-2.png" alt="Delphi Editor with macro toolbar" title="Delphi Editor with macro toolbar" />
		</p>
		<p>
			The Wizard also adds a new <em>Display Macro Toolbar</em> menu item to the end of Delphi's <em>View</em> menu that toggles the toolbar on and off.
		</p>
		<p class="alert alert-info">
			<strong>Please note:</strong> This wizard applies only to Delphi 7. The macro toolbar was not implemented in earlier versions and later versions have a completely different IDE.
