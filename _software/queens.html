			Development of <em>{{ page.title }}</em> is frozen.

			This program has roots going back to a Turbo Pascal DOS program from 1991. It's Windows incarnation goes back to the v2 release 1997 and was one of my early attempts at OOP using Delphi 1.
		</p>
		<p>
			The program has been given numerous overhauls over the years through 4 major versions, finally ending up as a heavily redesigned 32 bit Windows program.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2016 I decided it was time to let it be, so I released one final version in case anyone's interested.
		</p>
		<p>
			The source code remains available should anyone want to develop the program further. See below.

			A user guide, in PDF format, is included with the program.
		</p>
		<p>
			The main point of interest in writing this program was learning how to solve the problem. The answer lies in the source code, which is freely available. See below.
