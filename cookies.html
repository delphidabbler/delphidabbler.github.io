          <p>These cookies are essential for you to browse the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the site. Cookies that allow web shops to hold your items in your cart while you are shopping online are an example of strictly necessary cookies. These cookies will generally be first-party session cookies.

            <p>This cookie is set if the user has agreed for cookies to be used. It is used for two purposes:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>To record the fact that the user has so agreed. This constitutes the record of consent for the purposes of the EU's <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">GDPR</a>.</li>
              <li>To prevent the cookie compliance message from appearing on every page of the website!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The cookie expires after 182 days (approximately 6 months). No personally identified data is stored - the cookie's value is always <code>1</code>.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>One or more cookies of this form may be set to record that any &quot;flash&quot; messages displayed on various pages have been dismissed by the user. Without this cookie being set the flash message will be displayed on every page.</p>
            <p>The cookie expires after 365 days. No personally identified data is stored - the cookie's value is always <code>dismissed</code>.</p>
          </dd>

        </dl>

        <p class="alert alert-danger glyph">Anyone who used the website before 2022-11-20 may also have other cookies set. They are <code>cookieconsent_status</code>, <code>dd_inhibit_cookie_consent</code> and <code>dd_flash_1</code>). The first two cookies served a similar purpose to <code>dd-base--cookies-accepted</code> while <code>dd_flash_1</code> had the same purpose as the <code>dd-base--flash-XXX</code> cookies. An attempt has been made to delete these older cookies, but it is possible that they will remain in place until they expire. They can be deleted via your browser's settings.</p>

    <h3>Session Cookies</h3>

    <p>Only one session cookie is ever set.</p>

    <p>This cookie is only set if you click <em>Reject</em> in the cookie authorisation message. It prevents the message from re-appearing for the rest of the current session in the current browser tab. The cookie is cleared when the session ends. The cookie is named <code>dd-base--cookie-reject-session</code> and has the value <code>1</code>.</p>

    <p>This cookie is essential for site usability.</p>

  <section>

    <h2>Opting In or Out of Cookies</h2>

    <p>A pop-up message is displayed that permits you to opt in or out of cookies by clicking the <em>Accept</em> or <em>Reject</em> buttons, respectively.

    <p class="alert alert-info glyph">If you reject cookies then no new cookies will be set.</p>

    <h3>If you opt in</h3>

    <p>The pop-up message is hidden when you click the <em>Accept</em> button. Your opt-in lasts for about six months, during which time you should not see the pop-up message again. After that time you will be asked for your consent again.</p>

    <p>If you change your mind in the interim you can use an opt out link that appears in the footer of every page for as long as you're opted in.</p>

    <h3>If you opt out</h3>

    <p>The cookie pop-up message is hidden when you click the <em>Reject</em> button. The message will remain hidden until the end of your session. If you close the session then revisit the site, or open a page in a new tab, then the pop-up message will appear again. This is because a cookie has to be used to inhibit the appearance of the pop-up message but use of such cookies has been denied.</p>
