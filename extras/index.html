      I use <a href="https://infozip.sourceforge.net/">Info-ZIP's</a> <code>zip.exe</code> in most of my build scripts to create zip files. The site I have been recommending to download the program doesn't appear to have been maintained for a while and I'm concerned that it might go away. So I've decided to host <code>zip.exe</code> and <code>unzip.exe</code> myself, just to be on the safe side.

    <p>
      A zip file, <code>info-zip.zip</code>, has been uploaded to my Google Drive. The file contains <em>Windows</em> builds of zip v2.32 &amp; unzip v5.52, along with the required license. Clicking the following button will open a page on Google Drive that lists the contents of <code>info-zip.zip</code>. You will need to click the download button to get it.

        Yes, I realise storing a zip extractor in a .zip file is a bit recursive, but don't tell me you haven't got one already <span class="fa fa-smile-o"></span>.
