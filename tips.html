title: Hints & Tips

<h1 roll="heading">{{page.title | escape}}</h1>

<p>
  The old DelphiDabbler site had a relatively large Delphi Tips section. Unfortunately it will be a very big job porting the section over to this site. Since the tips are getting old I'm not sure if it's worth the effort.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
  If you are interested in seeing the old tips section making a comeback back please raise an issue on this site's <a href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/delphidabbler.github.io/issues">issues page</a> on GitHub (<small>GitHub account needed</small>). If there's enough interest I'll look into the practicalities of bringing the tips back.
</p>

<p>
  To make sure the tips (plus a few more) didn't get lost following the old site closure, I've created the <a href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/delphi-tips" aria-label="DelphiDabbler tips GitHub repo" class="strong">delphidabbler/tips</a> <span aria-hidden="true">repository on GitHub</span>.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to see the tips do take a look at them over on GitHub. They're available in two or three formats. There's also a couple of open document format documents containing more tips. For more info see the repository's read-me files.
