    The tips.delphidabbler.com sub-domain was only set up on 17 January 2022. Before that the tips micro site had the following URLs: <strong>delphidabbler.com/delphi-tips</strong> and <strong>delphidabbler.github.io/delphi-tips</strong>. If you have either of those bookmarked, please update them to the new URL. Luckily both the old URLs seem to be redirecting to the new one, <em>so far!</em>
