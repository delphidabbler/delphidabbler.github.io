<p>
  The old DelphiDabbler site had two web applications that displayed code snippets from two different sources:
</p>

<ol class="wide">
  <li>
    The DelphiDabbler Code Snippets &quot;Database&quot; of compilable Delphi Pascal snippets.
  </li>
  <li>
    The old SWAG (<b>S</b>ource<b>W</b>are <b>A</b>rchive <b>G</b>roup) collection of source code and programming examples.
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="alert alert-danger glyph">
  Both web apps depended on web services provided by the old web server and were lost when that server closed down. It would be a big job to recover and convert the apps.
</p>

<p>
  All is not lost. I have created a couple of Git repositories GitHub to hold the snippet collections. They are:
</p>

<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <p class="strong">
      <a href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/code-snippets" aria-label="DelphiDabbler Code Snippets database repository on GitHub">delphidabbler/code-snippets</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This repository contains all the snippets in the Code Snippets Database along with meta data stored in .ini files. The database is in the `csdb` directory off the repository root.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <p class="strong">
      <a href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/swag" aria-label="SWAG collection repository on GitHub">delphidabbler/swag</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This repository contains all the &quot;packets&quot; (a SWAG term for a snippet) in the collection along with an XML file containing meta data.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Both collections are comprehensively documented.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info glyph">
  The Code Snippets Database can be displayed by my <a href="{{ site.base-url }}/software/codesnip">CodeSnip</a> program. It can also import SWAG packages. In fact CodeSnip's SWAG import wizard contains a pretty reasonable SWAG viewer!
</p>

<h2>
  Tests
</h2>

<p>
  There are some unit tests available for a few of the snippets in the Code Snippets database. They can be downloaded from my GoogleDrive account as <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pH7LtyZY-ehwjJ4AjC801j-0bVMdLpsz/view?usp=sharing"><strong>CodeSnippetsUnitTests.zip</strong></a>.
