<p>
  I maintain two repositories of Pascal code snippets:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The <em>DelphiDabbler Code Snippets Collection</em>, which is an extensive collection of Delphi Pascal snippets.
  </li>
  <li>
    The old <em>SWAG</em> (<b>S</b>ource<b>W</b>are <b>A</b>rchive <b>G</b>roup) collection of source code and programming examples.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The repositories are:
</p>

<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <p class="strong">
      <a href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/code-snippets" aria-label="DelphiDabbler Code Snippets Collection on GitHub">delphidabbler/code-snippets</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This repository contains all the snippets in the <em>DelphiDabbler Code Snippets Collection</em> along with meta data stored in .ini files.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collection can be displayed by my <a href="/software/codesnip">CodeSnip</a> program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the snippets have unit tests or demo programs, all of which are available from the repository.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <p class="strong">
      <a href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/swag" aria-label="SWAG collection repository on GitHub">delphidabbler/swag</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This repository contains the <em>SWAG</em> collection. It contains all the &quot;packets&quot; (a SWAG term for a snippet) along with an XML file containing meta data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collection can be viewed using my <a href="/software/swagview">SWAGView</a> program. Selected SWAG packets can also be imported into <a href="/software/codesnip">CodeSnip</a>. 
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Both collections are comprehensively documented.
