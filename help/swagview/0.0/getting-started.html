<p>
    When you run <em>SWAGView</em> for the first time the display will be empty because the SWAG database has not been installed.
</p>

<p>
    To install SWAG do the following:
</p>

<ol class="wide">
    <li>
        Go to the <a href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/swag/releases">SWAG releases page</a> on Github.
    </li>
    <li>
        Choose the latest v1.0.x release (<em>SWAGView</em> doesn't know how to read any version including or after v1.1.x).
    </li>
    <li>
        Download the zip file named <code>dd-swag-&lt;version&gt;.zip</code> where &lt;version&gt; is the release version number. Make a note of the folder where you downloaded the file.
    </li>
    <li>
        In <em>SWAGView</em>, click the <em>Install SWAG Database...</em> button.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the resulting dialogue box enter the full path and file name of the zip file you downloaded in the edit box. You can click the <em>...</em> (ellipsis) button to the right of the edit box and choose the file from a standard file open dialogue box.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the <em>Install</em> button. This button will only be enabled if the file you entered exists.
    </li>
    <li>
        Wait for the database to be installed. A window will be displayed during this process. Expect it to take a few seconds to extract the data from the zip file and to copy it to the correct location &ndash; there are hundreds of small files to copy. 
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    If everything goes OK the SWAG categories will be displayed in the left hand pane of the main window. See the <a href="./overview">Overview</a> topic for information above how to use the program.
</p>

<p>
    The next time you start <em>SWAGView</em> it will find the database, so you don't need to do this process again.
</p>

<h2>
    Problems?
</h2>

<p>
    If anything goes wrong a message describing the problem will be displayed. This can happen for a few reasons:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        There was a file system problem. You might need to re-download the zip file.
    </li>
    <li>
        The file you selected is corrupt or is not a zip file. Try again and choose the correct file.
    </li>
    <li>
        The zip file does not contain the SWAG database. Try again and choose the correct file.
    </li>
    <li>
        The version of the database in the zip file is not supported. Try downloading a suitable version and try again.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Regardless of the reason for failure, the main display will remain empty and you can use the <em>Install SWAG Database...</em> button to try again.
